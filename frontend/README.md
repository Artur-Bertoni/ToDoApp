## Interface Guide

### Task Management Features

- **Add New Task**: Click the ["+" icon](./src/assets/img/add-icon.png) next to the title "TO DO LIST" to open the form for adding a new task.
    - You must provide a **title** and an optional **description** for the task.
    - The **deadline** field is not required, and tasks with expired deadlines will be highlighted in red.

- **Edit Task**: To edit an existing task, click the [pencil icon (✏️)](./src/assets/img/edit-icon.png) next to the task. A pop-up will appear where you can modify the title, description, and deadline (the rules for adding a task are also applied for editing).

- **Complete Task**: To mark a task as complete, simply check the box next to it. Completed tasks will be moved to the bottom of the list.

- **Delete Task**: To delete a task, click the [trash can icon (🗑️)](./src/assets/img/delete-icon.png) next to the task.

### Visual Cues

- **Past Deadline**: If a task’s deadline has passed, the deadline text will turn red.
- **Task Order**: Tasks are displayed in the order of their deadlines. Completed tasks are listed at the bottom, also ordered by their deadline.

### Navigation and Responsiveness
- The layout is responsive and will adjust for different screen sizes.
- Tasks are displayed in a list format, with each task having its own separate box with rounded borders.
